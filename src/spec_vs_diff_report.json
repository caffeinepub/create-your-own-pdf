  "summary": "The diff implements Tamil language support (REQ-20) in the PDF Translator and fixes download functionality for most PDF tools (REQ-21 through REQ-28). However, REQ-29 (comprehensive PDF Translator verification) appears only partially implemented, and the actual download button implementations are not fully visible in the truncated diffs.",

      "requirement": "Verify and ensure the PDF Translator reliably extracts text from uploaded PDFs, translates all content using the LibreTranslate API, and generates a downloadable translated PDF with preserved formatting",
      "reason": "While the translator code shows text extraction and translation logic in PdfTranslator.tsx, the diff is truncated before showing the complete translation implementation including PDF generation, download functionality, and error handling. Cannot verify all acceptance criteria are met.",
